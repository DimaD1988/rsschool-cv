About Me: I'm Dima. I was born and lived in Minsk, Belarus. In 2012 I finished my education and got my speciality "Ecomonist". In 2016 I decided to chance my life to better side. In early 2017 I got my second spetiality "CNC operator". Then, when I got my second spetiality I understood I loved programming... But I did not get a Job by spetiality (not enough qualificated). I decided to continue my education and next goal was learn English. In summer 2017 I passed one-week free english course (only practicle with Native). By the end of cource I installed Duolingo and comleted there all exercises by "Gold". Also I installed Tandem for continue my practicle with foreigners. In autumn same year I met young woman who wished to go to Russia as a student and I supported her as online translator all time in Russia. After time we become friend and from friendship it's become love. In Oktober 2020 we got married and live in Minsk for 8 months, after it we moved to Indonesia I am open minded, friendly, always excited and enthusiasm to learn new things or knowledges.
